excerpt: 'The clique graph $$kG$$ of a graph $$G$$ has as its vertices the cliques (maximal complete subgraphs) of $$G$$, two of which are adjacent in $$kG$$ if they have non-empty intersection in $$G$$. We say that $$G$$ is clique convergent if $$k^nG\not\cong k^mG$$
for some $$n\neq m$$, and that $$G$$ is clique divergent otherwise. We completely characterise the clique convergent graphs in the class of (not necessarily finite) locally cyclic graphs of minimum degree $$\delta\geq 6$$, showing that for such graphs clique divergence is a global phenomenon, dependent on the existence of large substructures. More precisely, we establish that such a graph is clique divergent if and only if its universal triangular cover contains arbitrarily large members from the family of so-called &quot triangular-shaped graphs &quot.'
