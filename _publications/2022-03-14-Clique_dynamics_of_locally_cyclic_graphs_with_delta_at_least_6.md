excerpt: 'We prove that the clique graph operator $$k$$ is divergent on a locally cyclic graph $$G$$ (i.e. $$N_G(v)$$ is a circle) with minimum degree $$\delta(G)=6$$
if and only if $$G$$ is $$6$$-regular. The clique graph $$kG$$ of a graph $$G$$ has the maximal complete subgraphs of G as vertices, and the edges are given by non-empty intersections. If all iterated clique graphs of $$G$$ are pairwise non-isomorphic, the graph $$G$$ is $$k$$-divergent; otherwise, it is $$k$$-convergent.
To prove our claim, we explicitly construct the iterated clique graphs of those infinite locally cyclic graphs with $$\delta\geq 6$$
which induce simply connected simplicial surfaces. These graphs are $$k$$-convergent if the size of triangular-shaped subgraphs of a specific type is bounded from above. We apply this criterion by using the universal cover of the triangular complex of an arbitrary finite locally cyclic graph with $$\delta=6$$, which shows our divergence characterisation.'
