excerpt: 'An edge k-weighting of a graph $G$ is a function For we denote by S(v) the multiset of weights on edges incident to v. We say that a weighting l induces a vertex coloring via a function f if for all adjacent vertices One corresponding coloring parameter is the f-neighbor-distinguishing index. It is the smallest value k such that a k-weighting induces a vertex coloring of G via f. In literature, several functions f, e.g., sums and products, and different additional constraints for the colorings have been studied. Thereby a lot of related coloring parameters arise. In this note, we introduce a class of functions, so-called dispersing functions. We prove bounds for three classes of coloring parameters, which are induced by edge weightings via arbitrary dispersing functions.'
