excerpt: 'An edge k-weighting of a graph $$G=(V,E)$$ is a function $$l\colon E\to \{1,\ldots,k\}.$$ For $$v\in V$$ we denote by $$S(v)$$ the multiset of weights on edges incident to $$v$$. We say that a weighting $$l$$ induces a vertex coloring via a function $$f$$ if $$f(S(v))\neq f(S(u))$$ for all adjacent vertices $$u,v\in V$$. One corresponding coloring parameter is $$\chi_f(G)$$, the $$f$$-neighbor-distinguishing index. It is the smallest value $$k$$ such that a $$k$$-weighting induces a vertex coloring of G via f. In literature, several functions f, e.g., sums and products, and different additional constraints for the colorings have been studied. Thereby a lot of related coloring parameters arise. In this note, we introduce a class of functions, so-called dispersing functions. We prove bounds for three classes of coloring parameters, which are induced by edge weightings via arbitrary dispersing functions.'
